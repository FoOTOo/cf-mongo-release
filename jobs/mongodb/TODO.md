====

 - Figure out how MongoDB username/password works. Here it only looks like a Windows service and cluster thing: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/configuration-options/ - so setting must be elsewhere.
 - Generate random credentials and database name on `provision_instance` whence this information isn't specified by user
 - Hashicorp Vault
